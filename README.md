# SAFATECHNOLOGY LTD — HTML & CSS Website

Simple static website built with plain HTML and a single external CSS file. This repository contains the pages created for the Safatechnology Ltd project and demonstrates fundamentals of semantic HTML and responsive CSS.

## How to preview
- Open `index.html` in any modern browser (double-click the file or use your browser's "Open File" command).
- No build step or server is required — this is an HTML-only project.

## Project files
- `index.html` — Home page
- `about.html` — About / owner info
- `services.html` — Services list and table
- `contact.html` — Contact page with embedded map, contact details, and a contact form
- `form.html` — Simple form demo page
- `media.html` — Images, audio and video examples
- `styles.css` — Centralized stylesheet used by all pages
- Several image and media files used by pages (e.g. `pic.jpeg`, `me.jpeg`, `reb.mp4`, `jesus.mp3`)

## Features
- Centralized, well-organized `styles.css` covering:
  - Typography and color choices
  - Flexbox-based navigation
  - Responsive layout with media queries
  - Styled forms, tables, and media elements
  - Accessibility-friendly focus outlines
- Navigation present on every page for easy browsing
- Contact page includes a responsive contact form (HTML-only). The form is client-side only — submitting will not send emails without a backend or mail service.

## Notes for students
- This project is designed for learning CSS fundamentals. Be prepared to explain the rules you add or change (selectors, box model, flexbox, pseudo-classes, media queries).
- To enable actual message sending from the contact form, you'll need a server endpoint or form-handling service (not included to keep this assignment HTML/CSS-only).

## How to customize
- Change colors, fonts, and spacing in `styles.css`.
- Replace images in the project folder and update the `src` attributes in HTML if needed.
